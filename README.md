*Instagram* is an android app that fetches the popular feeds using Instagram API's and displays them in a grid view.

Completed user stories:

 * User can scroll through current popular photos from Instagram
 * For each photo displayed, user can see Graphic, Caption, Username, likes count and user profile image.
 * Add pull-to-refresh for popular stream with SwipeRefreshLayout
 * Show latest comment for each photo (bonus: show last 2 comments)
 * Display each user profile image using a RoundedImageView
 * Display a nice default placeholder graphic for each image during loading (read more about Picasso).
 * Improve the user interface through styling and coloring
 * Apply the popular Butterknife annotation library to reduce view boilerplate
